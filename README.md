# Enterprise RAG Evaluation Platform

A production-oriented RAG blueprint for governed, measurable, enterprise knowledge retrieval.

## Business problem

Policy and SOP assistant demo with hybrid retrieval, citation enforcement, and release gate scoring.

## Why it matters

Senior AI portfolios need to show more than framework familiarity. This repository demonstrates how business value, architecture thinking, measurable controls, and reproducible demos come together in an enterprise AI asset.

## Solution overview

Policy and SOP assistant demo with hybrid retrieval, citation enforcement, and release gate scoring.

## Demo

Run the included demo from the repository root:

`ash
python demo/run_demo.py
`

The demo uses sample data in data/ and deterministic Python logic in src/rag_platform/main.py, so it is easy to review without cloud credentials or paid APIs.

## Architecture

See docs/architecture.md for the reference architecture and operating model. See docs/demo.md for the demo walkthrough.

## Featured evaluation asset

- [RAG Evaluation Report Pack](docs/RAG-EVALUATION-REPORT-PACK.md): release-readiness scorecard, hard gates, failure register, and executive review format for enterprise RAG systems.

## Roadmap

- Add a richer UI or dashboard layer
- Add architecture diagrams and deployment examples
- Add more realistic enterprise data samples
- Extend tests into quality, policy, and regression gates

## Enterprise relevance

This repo is designed as a public, reviewable artifact for senior AI leadership conversations: the business case is clear, the architecture is documented, the demo is runnable, and the controls are explicit.
